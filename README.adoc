= scheme-motions.nvim

Manipulate TSNodes, rather than raw text motions.

Scheme is almost uniquely poorly situated to strictly text-based editing.
Something like `paredit` or `parinfer` provides a better editing experience, though both have their flaws.

This aims to provide a more vim-first approach to manipulating s-expressions.
